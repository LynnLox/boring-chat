For the time being (6th November, 2022), I am done with the project, and no
major (and maybe even minor) changes will be made in the immediate future
(unless my fickle mind changes).

For anyone who comes across this project (including a future me), the following
are what can be implemented:

1. The "name is too long" error does not need to come from the server. This is
something that the client can compute by itself before even passing the name to
the server. So take care of it on the client-side.

2. It would be nice to have a header, like "boring chat".

3. Experiment with different colour combinations, instead of submitting to the
terminal's defaults.

4. Add special server commands like in Discord.

5. Let the user specify the port in addition to the address as the 2nd
command-line argument, like telnet does, instead of hardcoding it to 9034.

6. Implement signals, such as for Crtl-C and something in Beej' guide that I
have now forgotten.

7. Come up with a better name. I used a grand total of 1.24 brain cells in
deciding this one.
